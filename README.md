 # Spam Filter  

This project implements a **Spam Filter** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.  
The notebook `spam_filter.ipynb` demonstrates how to preprocess text data, train a classification model,  
and evaluate its performance in distinguishing between spam and ham (non-spam) messages.

## ðŸ“Œ Features  
- Data preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, text cleaning).  
- Feature extraction (Bag of Words / TF-IDF).  
- Machine Learning model training (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, etc.).  
- Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix).  
- Predictions on new/unseen messages.
